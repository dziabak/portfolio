            <p class="text-xl font-rubik leading-6 mb-4">I joined the team when the game was already halfway through its
                production, with many
                different features and functionalities already established, however many of them still in need of
                iteration
                and redesign. Most of my work on the project was realized during that process and usually I had to work
                in
                the already established boundaries, always needing to take into the account how I can use the existing
                functionalities and improve upon them.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="container space-y-8 font-rubik">

            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="text-xl font-medium uppercase">Game Design</p>

                <p class="text-md">One of the biggest features I was working on was the deliveries system, tightly
                    connected
                    to the game balancing and the overall game progression.</p>
                <p class="text-md">In the process of designing the feature I was responsible for setting up the prefabs
                    of
                    different trailers for the deliveries as well as coming up with the ideas for the cargo. Some of
                    them
                    were made into special models.</p>
                <p class="text-md">This system was connected to the game progression system and was taking into the
                    account
                    several
                    factors, such as player level, truck level, rarity and quality of the cargo, size of the cargo and
                    distances between the cities. Some deliveries had special modifiers influencing the way the player
                    had
                    to handle the cargo (fragile cargo, illegal cargo, oversized cargo) and of course the faster the
                    player
                    would complete the delivery, the better the reward.</p>
                <p class="text-md">This way the player was always presented with a breadth of choices, each with their
                    own
                    pros and cons. Some of the deliveries had special modifiers and could be easily damaged while some
                    jobs
                    required to travel over great distances or some required special truck upgrades.</p>

                <p class="text-xl font-medium uppercase">UI/UX Design</p>

                <p class="text-md">In the project I was the main person responsible for the UI design. From the moment
                    I've started working on the project up until its release I was solely responsible for the game UI
                    setup
                    and maintaining its functionalities. This process involved:</p>
                <p class="text-md">Implementing the flows and functionalities of the UI.</p>
                <p class="text-md">Requesting, adjusting and working with the art provided by the UI artist.</p>
                <p class="text-md">Implementing the solutions using the logic and scripts provided by the UI
                    programmers.</p>
                <p class="text-md">Working with the localization files, organizing them and verifying their proper
                    implementation throughout the game.</p>
                <p class="text-md">At one point in the project the publisher requested a complete UI redesign so it
                    would be more in line with the other simulation games they have published in the past. This required
                    some serious changes in the overall look, design and navigation of the UI. During this process I was
                    closely working with the UI artist and UI programmer in order to deliver on the vision requested by
                    the
                    publisher.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="text-xl font-medium uppercase">Extra</p>

                <p class="text-md">During the final production stages and the post release support I was also in part
                    responsible for the preparation of the releasable builds of the game and providing them to the
                    publisher
                    for the later build deployment. This covered all major patches as well as the minor fixes. During
                    that
                    process I was also responsible for providing the patch notes which would be later included on the
                    store
                    page.</p>
                <p class="text-md">In the project I've become known for keeping notes and documenting as much of the
                    processes I was involved with as possible. In addition to the GDD I began collecting the data on
                    many
                    features in the game, so they can be easily found and referenced throughout the later development of
                    the
                    game.</p>
